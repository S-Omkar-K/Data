##Coefficient of age_monts observed = 6105.2
##COEFF_3 = 6105.2
##For 1 month increase in age of an individual
##the wages will increase by an estimate of 6105.2 cents
##Relationship between COEFF_1, COEFF_2
##COEFF_2 = COEFF_1 * 100
##As we multiplied the dependent variable wages in dollars
##to transform it into cents, the estimated coefficient of the
##resultant variable is multiplied by 100. Hence we get COEFF_2 as 100 * COEFF_1
##Relationship between COEFF_2 and COEFF_3
##COEFF_3 = COEFF_2/12 => (COEFF_1*100/12)
##As we multiplied the dependent variable age in years
##to transform it into months, the estimated coefficient of the
##resultant variable is divided by 12
