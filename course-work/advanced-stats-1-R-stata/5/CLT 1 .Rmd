# This program is written for PP 310 to show students how to write an R script
# for doing Monte Carlo simulations. We run 1000 simulations for each of sample size of
# 10, 20, 30, 50, 200, 500, and 2000.  We save the relevant data sets
# some summary statistics

# We assume you are in the correct working directory. Use getwd() to check.

# clear working memory
rm(list=ls())    

# Open output file for results
sink("simulate_CLT.Rout", split=TRUE)

# We need rmutil library for the laplace distribution
# you may need to install.package()
