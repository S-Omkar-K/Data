### 4: Using data from Homework 4, test the hypothesis that African American women and white women ages 25-55 (inclusive) have the same total income. Use a two-sided t-test with a 95% confidence level. How confident of this test are you? Why?

```{r}
data <- data %>% 
  mutate(isEmployed = ifelse(data$empstat == 'Employed', 1, 0)) 
data <- data %>% 
  mutate(isEmployed = as.factor(isEmployed))
data_income_AA_White <- data %>% 
  filter(data$isEmployed == 1) %>% 
  group_by(race) %>% 
  summarize(count_employed = n(),
            total_income = sum(inctot, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_income = mean(inctot, na.rm = TRUE))

```



#Two-sided t-test with a 95% confidence level
#Null hypotheses:True difference in Mean is 0 for African American women and White women with age range [25-55]
#Alternative hypotheses: True difference in Mean is not 0 for African American women and white women with age range [25-55]

```{r}
data_AA_employed <- data %>% 
  filter(data$isEmployed == 1 & data$isAfricanAmerican == 1 )

data_totalIncome_AA_employed <- c(data_AA_employed$inctot)

data_White_employed <- data %>% 
  filter(data$isEmployed == 1 & data$isAfricanAmerican == 0 )
data_totalIncome_White_employed <- c(data_White_employed$inctot)

t.test(data_totalIncome_AA_employed, data_totalIncome_White_employed, alternative = "two.sided",
       var.equal = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95)
```
#Observations
#Observed p-value = 1.728e-11 for the two-sided t-test with a 95% confidence, is less than the standard 0.05 and thus we can reject the null hypothes. Thus, we cannot reject the alternative hypotheses that the true difference in means for White Women and African-American Womnan with age range [25:55] is not 0.

```{r}
t.test(data_totalIncome_AA_employed, data_totalIncome_White_employed, alternative = "less", 
       var.equal = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95)
```
#The one sided p value is 8.64e-12 which is less than 0.05. Thus, we can reject the null hypotheses and not reject thealternate hypotheses.


```{r}
t.test(data_totalIncome_AA_employed, data_totalIncome_White_employed, alternative = "greater", 
       var.equal = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95)
```


#Looking at the p values in the above tests, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the the total income of the African American women ages 25-55 (inclusive) is less that the white women age range [25:55]
