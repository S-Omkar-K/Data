In case, we have both the data of a person, we can effectively compare the results in both the cases i.e vaccinated state and unvaccinated state. As we donot have the complete data, we cannot construct a counterfactual which deems these experimental trials cannot be considered legitimate. Thus, the comparision of efficacies of two vaccines cannot be considered legit.Another argument is, because we do not have a treatment and control group. If we were to have data of both the treatment and control group, then we can treat this experiment triel as legitimate. Thus the insights we got from comparison of efficacies of the two vaccines based on only the treatment group data is not legitimate.

#We observed the following p values t-test : 0.0185 , Chi-square test : 0.02, Fisher exact test : 0.0218. As we compare the different tests, Fisher exact test is preferred as its an asymptotic test and fits for the binary data such as to compare the treated/non treated data. Fisher test also provides an accurate significance level without relying on the assumptions where as asymptotic tests make assumptions about the data. When we have extremely large sample size, then it is infeasable to perform Fisher test. In such situations, we can prefer Chi-square test as the accuracy increases as the sample size increases.

#As seen above, the treatment indicator Coeff/estimate decreases slightly, but however it can still be considered that the treatment indicator still has majority of influence on the work.
