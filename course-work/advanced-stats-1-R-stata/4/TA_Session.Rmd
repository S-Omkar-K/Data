## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.










Delete income less than 0

data <- data %>$ filter(inctot = 0)

data <- data %>% mutate(age = as.numeric(age))

summary(data$age)

data <- data %>% filter(age <= 25 & age )


data <- data %>% mutate(edu_level = as.factor(edu_level))



Create a dummy variable 

data$edu_level[data$educd == "1 or more years of college credit, no degre"] <- "Some College"


summary(data_atrget$inctot[data_target$sex == "Female"])

Use wrap instead of printing statistics multiple types
